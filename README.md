# Safe AGI For Everyone

Safe AGI For Everyone, or SAFE, is a project to develop the type of AGI that you own, you understand, and you trust.

## A network of Meta AGIs

There may be thousands of unique approaches to an AGI that works for everyone. Each approach becomes a Meta AGI that defines what we're doing, why we're doing it that way, and how we know we're on the right track.

Safe AGI For Everyone provides a way to connect, compare, and collaborate within and across our various Meta AGIs.

## What is a Meta AGI?

A Meta AGI is like a family branch. Each Meta AGI answers these key questions its own way:

1. What is intelligence?
2. What is AGI?
3. How shall AGI be achieved?
4. How is progress toward AGI measured?

The answers to these questions form an additional set of constraints on each AGI in its family that enable easy comparison and open collaboration.

If you don't find a Meta AGI you like, go ahead and design your own.
